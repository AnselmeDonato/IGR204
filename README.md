IGR204 - Baby Names

This is a mini-report presenting the results of our mini-project of visualisation of the evolution of baby names. 

The three main questions were : 

How do baby names evolve over time? Are there names that have consistently remained popular or unpopular? Are there some that have were suddenly or briefly popular or unpopular? Are there trends in time? 
Is there a regional effect in the data? Are some names more popular in some regions? Are popular names generally popular across the whole country? 
Are there gender effects in the data? Does popularity of names given to both sexes evolve consistently? 

The three visualisation answering those points are in the .twb document attached (Visu1, Visu2 and Visu3) but here is some screenshots and some findings : 







First point: trend in names

This one is a bit tricky : we created a graph showing the 7 most popular names of the century, based on total number across the century but this is kind of biased by the evolution of demography : a name given at 1% of the newborn babies during the baby-boom will have an overall "number of time given across the century" much higher than a name given at 1% of the newborn babies in 2020. Yet, in this first graph we can see that rare names ("_PRENOMS_RARES") have become more and more prevalent over the recent years. 

In order to have another insight of the evolution of popularity of names, we made another graph showing the names given more than 250 times a year (arbitrary number empirically chosen to have a handful of names each year)




While we can also see the impact of demography on this graph (a lot more names were given during the baby boom), this graph also confirm that the most popular names during 1900-1960 have been rapidly overtaken by rare names at the end of the 20th century.  

Note : ultimately we wanted to make a graph showing only the top 7 names given per year but we didn't succeed in tweaking tableau desktop to do so. 

Finally, what about the unpopular names ? To represent them, we changed the former graph to display the names given less than 10 times a year : 













We can learn two things from this graph : 
First, there are so many "unpopular names" that it's hard to conclude wether there are some trends or not among them (moreover, as you can see in the legend, "_PRENOM RARES" or rare names are not even individually displayed, which would clutter the graph even more). 
Second : "unpopular names" tend to be more and more popular across the years, as there are many more different names in 2016 than in 1897

This leads us to the answer :
There has been an evolution of names in the recent years : the trending names during the mid 20th century, such as "Jean", "Marie" and "Michel" has been overtaken by more "uncommon" names that are so diverse that it's hard to display each and every single one of them.




















Second point: regional influence  



Once again, we see the influence of demography : the Île-de-France region (75) has given a lot more names than the other ones. 

Answer: 
All in all, there are not so much regional influence in the data : some regions stand out in terms of rare names (a lot of rare names un 91 and above, and not so many in 22 and 29) but apart from that, the name ratios are quite consistent across the country.











Third point: gender influence


Those graphs, based on the one of Visu1 but splitting the two genders, show us that women have had more diverse names from longer than the men : since 1918, while common men names keep on growing, common women names started to decline, shattering in "uncommun" names. At the end of the century though this "gender gap" disappeared and today men and women seems to have equal proportions of rare names. 

Answer: 
The popularity of names have not evolved equally in the second part of the 20th century, when women had more diverse names than men. But nowadays, this gap has been bridged, and the evolution is about the same.
